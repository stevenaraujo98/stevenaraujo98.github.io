This paper presents the design and implementation details of a system build-up by using off-the-shelf algorithms for urban video analytics. The system allows the connection to public video surveillance camera networks to obtain the necessary information to generate statistics from urban scenarios (e.g., amount of vehicles, type of cars, direction, numbers of persons, etc.), The obtained information could be used not only for traffic management but also to estimate the carbon footprint of urban scenarios. As a case study, a university campus is selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The system is implemented in a modular way so that it is being used as a testbed to evaluate different algorithms. Implementation results are provided showing the validity and utility of the proposed approach.
